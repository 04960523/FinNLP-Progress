| Theil et al. (2019) | [PRoFET: Predicting the Risk of Firms from Event Transcripts](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/724) | They present a new dataset of 90K earnings call transcripts [(open source)](https://github.com/samuelbroscheit/neural-profet) | BiLSTM | Linear correlation coefficient Pearson’s r, the Non-linear rank correlation coefficients Spearman’s ρ and Kendall’s τ, and the MSE | 2002–2017 | They introduce PRoFET, the first neural model for volatility prediction jointly exploiting both semantic language representations and a comprehensive set of financial features | IJCAI-19 |

(2020) | [HTML: Hierarchical Transformer-based Multi-task Learning for Volatility Prediction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380128) | [Code](https://github.com/YangLinyi/HTML-Hierarchical-Transformer-based-Multi-task-Learning-for-Volatility-Prediction) | HTML (Hiererachical Transformer with Multi-task Learning) | MSE | S&P 500 companies in 2017 | This paper demonstrates very significant improvements in prediction accuracy, in the range 17% - 49% compared to the current state-of-the-art. | WWW-20 |
| Ye et al. (2020) | [Financial Risk Prediction with Multi-Round Q&A Attention Network](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/631) | 6494 text-only samples | Bidirectional LSTM | MSE | 2015-2018 | Instead of word-level or document level feature extraction, they focus on dialogues in the conference. Through extracting features of each round of dialogue, the model predicts the financial volatility. Compared to the most common baseline, past volatility, proposed model achieves 47% improvement in 3-days span, 31% in 7-days span, and 23% in 15-days span. | IJCAI-20 |

| Bisi et al. (2020) | [Risk-Averse Trust Region Optimization for Reward-Volatility Reduction](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/632) | \ | \ | On a simplified portfolio management task, proposed algorithms are proved to get lower Reward Volatility than baseline.
