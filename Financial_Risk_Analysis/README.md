(2020) | [Financial Risk Analysis for SMEs with Graph-based Supply Chain Mining](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/643) | Alipay Ant SME Lending (NOT open-sourced) | Spatial-temporal aware Graph Neural Network | Outperforms traditional Tree-based models and GNN-based models | \ | Analyze financial risk through mining the supply chain between Small and Medium-size Enterprises | CS | 
| Ye et al. (2020) | [Financial Risk Prediction with Multi-Round Q&A Attention Network](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/631) | Scraped from Seeking Alpha, select stock companies from S&P500.  Finally, there are 6494 samples (open source) | Bidirectional LSTM | Compared to the most common baseline, past volatility, proposed model achieves 47% improvement in 3-days span, 31% in 7-days span, and 23% in 15-days span | -/-/2015- -/-/2018 | Instead of word-level or document level feature extraction, they focus on dialogues in the conference. Through extracting features of each round of dialogue, the model predicts the financial volatility.| CS |
| Bisi et al. (2020) | [Risk-Averse Trust Region Optimization for Reward-Volatility Reduction](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/632) | \ | \ | On a simplified portfolio management task, proposed algorithms are proved to get lower Reward Volatility than baseline. Most of proof is given in theoretical derivation. | \ | In many cases, the risk is measured not only on a long-term perspective, but also on a step-wise reward. (like on a daily base) | Eco |
